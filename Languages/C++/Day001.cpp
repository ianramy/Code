// The C++ code is more verbose than the C code, but it is also more readable and easier to understand.
// The C++ code uses the iostream library to print the output, which is more intuitive than the printf function in C.
// The C++ code also uses the std namespace to avoid conflicts with other libraries, making the code more robust.
// Overall, the C++ code is more modern and user-friendly than the C code.
