// Languages - Rust - Day 1
// Foundational Concepts: Basics, syntax, loops, conditionals, functions, and variables.

// Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}

// Rust is a statically typed language, which means that the type of every variable must be known at compile time.
// The main function is the entry point of a Rust program. It is where the program starts executing. The fn keyword is used to declare a function in Rust.
// The main function does not take any arguments and does not return a value, so its signature is fn main() {}. The curly braces {} are used to define the body of the function.
// The println! macro takes a string as an argument and prints it to the console. The string is enclosed in double quotes. The println! macro automatically adds a newline character at the end of the output.
// The semicolon at the end of the line indicates the end of the statement. Rust does not require semicolons at the end of every line, but they are required at the end of statements.
// To run the program, save the code in a file with a .rs extension (e.g., hello.rs) and use the rustc compiler to compile it. The resulting executable can be run from the command line.
// rustc hello.rs
