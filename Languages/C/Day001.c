// Languages - C - Day 1
// Foundational Concepts: Basics, syntax, loops, conditionals, functions, and variables.

// Write a C program that prints "Hello, World!\n" to the console.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello, World!\\n");
    return 0;
}

// The C code uses the printf function to print the output, which is less intuitive than the cout function in C++.
// The C code does not use the std namespace, which can lead to conflicts with other libraries.
// The C code is more verbose and less user-friendly than the C++ code.
// Overall, the C code is less modern and less readable than the C++ code.
