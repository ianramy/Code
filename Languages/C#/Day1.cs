// Foundational Concepts: Basics, syntax, loops, conditionals, functions, and variables.

// Write a program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.

using System;
class HelloWorld {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}

// C# is a statically-typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time.
// The 'Main' method is the entry point of a C# program. It is the method that is called when the program is started.
// The 'Console.WriteLine' method is used to print a line of text to the console.
// The semicolon (;) is used to terminate statements in C#.
