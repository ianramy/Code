// Languages - Go - Day 1
// Foundational Concepts: Basics, syntax, loops, conditionals, functions, and variables.

// Write a program that prints “Hello, World!” to the screen.

package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}

// Go is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time.
// The type of the variable is specified after the variable name.
// The fmt.Println() function is used to print the output to the screen.
