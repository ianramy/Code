// Write a program that prints out "Hello, World!" to the console.

console.log("Hello, World!");

// JavaScript uses the console.log() function to print to the console. The console is a built-in object that provides access to the browser's debugging console. The console.log() function is used to print messages to the console. In this case, the message is "Hello, World!".
// The semicolon at the end of the statement is optional in JavaScript, but it is a good practice to include it to avoid potential issues with automatic semicolon insertion.
